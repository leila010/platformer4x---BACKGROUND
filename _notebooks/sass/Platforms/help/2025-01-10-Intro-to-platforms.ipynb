    "<h5><span style=\"; color:#9999ff\"> Platforms are one of the base foundations of platformer 4x. After all, what would you do, if there wasn't a floor, paths or blocks to stand on? They are the building blocks that allow characters to traverse the game world. Without them, there would be no way to move, jump, or exploreâ€”leaving the game static and uninteresting. Therefore in this lesseon you will learn the basics of platforms in Platformer4x, including adding platforms, designing platforms, positioning platforms and implenting them in special game aspects."
