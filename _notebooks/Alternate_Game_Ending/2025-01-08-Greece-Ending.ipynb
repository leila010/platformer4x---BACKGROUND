    "Firstly, we added a coin on of the wall sprites so if the user hit it, then only could they actually enter\n",
    "the flag and transition on to the next level.\n",
    "Nextly, I also figured out how to spawn and place currently uploadede sprites onto the displlay screen\n",
    "for users to interact with, which is how I physicaally added a seperate path usinng sprites and x\n",
    "and y percentages parameters, which were basically coordinates of the screen where the top left was (0,0)\n",
    "Geometric, am I right? This was to have another cooler way to get to the flag and end the level to move\n",
    "on to the next, and I also make the coin apply to this path as well. An issue I had was the jump height\n",
    "factor though, which I had to significantly decrease to make sure the level was somewhat hard \n",
    "to beat and to make the newly added sprires relevant and usable.\n",
