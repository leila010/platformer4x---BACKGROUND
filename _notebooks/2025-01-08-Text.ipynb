This makes it so that each fact/message is displayed for 3 seconds before the next one is displayed. You can change this by changing the number of milliseconds to make the time in between shorter or longer to whatever you prefer. After the generate function is called, the counter is updated. The counter keeps track of how many times a fact was displayed and with conditional stops the interval once all the facts have been displayed."
