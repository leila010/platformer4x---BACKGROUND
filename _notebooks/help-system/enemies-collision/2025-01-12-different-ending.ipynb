In our team's level for the Mario Game (level 1), we created a lock and key system. If the player obtained the key, then Mario would be able to exit the level. However, if Mario did not collect the key, they would not be able to exit the level. Also, the tube was changed to a door, and we animated the door. When the player got the key and collided with the door, the door would \"open\", and the player would be able to go through. If you can, try playing with the first level.

    "Here are some ideas to get you started:\n",
    "1. Collect All Coins\n",
    "- Mechanic: Mario must collect all the coins in the level to trigger the exit.\n",
    "- How it works: Once Mario collects the last coin, a special exit point (like a flagpole or warp pipe) appears, allowing him to leave the level.\n",
    "2. Defeat All Enemies\n",
    "- Mechanic: Mario must defeat every enemy in the level before the exit becomes available.\n",
    "- How it works: The game could provide a counter to show how many enemies are left. Once the final enemy is defeated, a victory sound plays, and the exit appears.\n",
    "3. Time Challenge\n",
    "- Mechanic: Mario must reach a specific location or collect a certain number of items within a time limit to unlock the exit.\n",
    "- How it works: If the time runs out, Mario loses a life. If successful, the exit becomes accessible.\n",
    "4. Puzzle Completion\n",
    "- Mechanic: Mario must solve a puzzle (e.g., moving blocks to a specific configuration, hitting switches in the correct order) to unlock the exit.\n",
    "- How it works: The puzzle could involve environmental elements like moving platforms or hidden triggers.\n",
    "5. Star Power Activation\n",
    "- Mechanic: Mario must find and collect a hidden star item in the level to power up the exit.\n",
    "- How it works: Once the star is collected, the exit becomes available, but enemies temporarily speed up or get tougher.\n",
    "6. Ally Rescue\n",
    "- Mechanic: Mario must find and rescue a trapped ally (e.g., Toad, a Yoshi egg) hidden somewhere in the level.\n",
    "- How it works: Once the ally is rescued, they follow Mario, and both must reach a specific point to finish the level.\n",
    "7. Environmental Cleanup\n",
    "- Mechanic: Mario must \"fix\" the environment by collecting trash (e.g., broken blocks, debris) or planting flowers in designated spots.\n",
    "- How it works: Once the environment is restored, the level exit becomes available.\n",
    "8. Coin Race\n",
    "- Mechanic: Certain coins appear only for a limited time, and Mario must collect all of them before they disappear to finish the level.\n",
    "- How it works: If Mario misses even one coin, the timer resets, and he has to try again.\n",
    "9. Boss Fight\n",
    "- Mechanic: Instead of a door, Mario encounters a mini-boss or a group of tougher enemies guarding the exit.\n",
    "- How it works: Defeating the boss unlocks the way forward.\n",
    "10. Build the Exit\n",
    "- Mechanic: Mario must find scattered parts of an exit (e.g., a broken bridge, pieces of a warp pipe) and assemble them.\n",
    "- How it works: Each piece is hidden or guarded, and once all are collected, the exit activates."
